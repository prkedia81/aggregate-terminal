                <h4>What is CAGR?</h4>
                Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is a measure of the average yearly growth of your investments over a
                certain time period. It tells you the average rate of return you have earned on your investments every
                year. CAGR is very useful for investors because it is an accurate measure of investment growth (or fall)
                over time.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>CAGR vs. Absolute returns</h4>
                Many people look at their investment returns in absolute terms. Absolute returns tell you how much your
                investment has earned over the entire duration. Let us take a hypothetical example. Imagine that you
                have invested ₹20,000 in a mutual fund in 2015. The value of the investment is ₹35,000 in 2020.
                <br><br>
                In absolute terms, you have earned a 75% return on your investment over a five-year period. While this
                sounds very good, it does not give you the full picture. In other words, you do not know the average
                rate of return you have earned on your investment every year.
                <br><br>
                As an investor, it is important to know how well your investments have performed on an average year on
                year. CAGR can be very helpful in such a situation.

                <h4>The CAGR Formula</h4> 
                Let's briefly discuss the CAGR formula.
                <br><br>
                The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) formula is:
                <br><br>
                <strong>CAGR =(Ending balance/beginning balance)<sup>1/n</sup> - 1</strong>                
                <br><br>
                Here,
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ending Balance</strong> is the value of the investment at the end of the investment period</li>
                    <li><strong>Beginning Balance</strong> is the value of the investment at the beginning of the investment period</li>
                    <li><strong>N</strong> is the number of years you have invested</li>                                                
                </ul>                
                Let's use this formula for the above hypothetical example.
                <br><br>
                CAGR = (35000/20000)<sup>1/5</sup> - 1
                <br>
                => CAGR = 11.84%
                <br><br>
                This means, your investment in the mutual fund has given you an average return of <strong>11.84%</strong>
                 every year.
